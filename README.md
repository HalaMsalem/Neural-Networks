### üîπ Project: Face Recognition with Neural Networks
**Objective:**  
The project develops a **face recognition system** using the ORL Faces Dataset. The approach combines:  
- **Feature Extraction** ‚Üí Local Binary Patterns (LBP)  
- **Classification** ‚Üí Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with backpropagation  
- **Evaluation** ‚Üí Train/validation/test split with accuracy measurement  

The system achieved a **98.33% test accuracy** on 40 subjects.

**Table of Contents (summary):**
